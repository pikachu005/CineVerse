Build “CineVerse” – Homepage + About + Contact (Responsive, Dark/Light)

Assets you have

Hero image:i've sending you along with ths message (use this exact image)

Logo image (icon only, no text): attacthed_asstes>CineVerseLogo_1757056535117.png

Requirements
1) Hero (main home screen)

Use the provided hero image as the full-bleed background.

Always center the image; do not crop from the top in any device orientation (mobile/landscape/tablet/desktop).

Apply a soft blur to the hero image (CSS filter or overlay blur) so overlaid text is readable.

Overlay headline with a typing effect:

Text: “Welcome to CineVerse – Your Gateway to the World of Cinema!”

Animate like typewriter: type letter-by-letter.

When the full sentence completes, hold for 5 seconds, then delete letter-by-letter, and loop forever.

Smooth cursor/blink; performance-friendly (requestAnimationFrame or efficient JS).

2) Header & Logo

Use only the provided logo image (icon) — no “CineVerse” text in the header.

Increase the logo image size so it’s visually prominent but still responsive.

Sticky header on scroll, with subtle blur/backdrop and 12–16px padding.

3) Footer

Add a clean, centered footer with:

© 2025 CineVerse. All rights reserved.

Links: About | Contact

Keep spacing generous and typography consistent; on mobile stack items vertically.

4) About Us Section

Add a section titled About CineVerse describing features of the movie site (discover movies across Hollywood/Bollywood/Tollywood, trending lists, trailers, ratings, storylines, cast & crew, genres, release dates, revenue, etc.).

Include the line: “Powered by TMDB” (use the exact capitalization).

Include “Developed by Ram Krishna Jha.”

5) Contact Us Section

Add a Contact form with fields:

Name (text)

Surname (text)

Email (email)

Message (multiline textarea)

Send Message (primary button)

Basic client-side validation (required fields, valid email). Show success/error states.

6) Dark/Light Mode

Implement a Dark/Light toggle button in the header:

Animated and interactive (e.g., sun ↔ moon morph, smooth 250–400ms transition).

Persist preference using localStorage.

Respect prefers-color-scheme on first load.

Ensure all components (hero text, footer, forms, links, buttons) adapt correctly to both modes with accessible contrast.

7) Responsiveness & Accessibility

Fully responsive (mobile-first). Breakpoints for ~375px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px.

Keep hero headline legible on small screens (wrap text, clamp font sizes).

Use semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer, nav, form, label).

Keyboard-navigable; focus styles visible; aria labels for the theme toggle and typing headline.

8) Deliverables

Home page with hero + typing loop, enlarged logo header, and footer.

About section on the home page (or separate route/anchor).

Contact section with working client-side validation.

Dark/Light toggle with animation and saved preference.

Pixel-perfect transparency preserved in images; hero never crops from top.
