1) Hero Section

Background: Use the hero image (as before, centered, not cropped from top, responsive).

Overlay text:

“Welcome to CineVerse – Your Gateway to the World of Cinema!”

Text should have a gradient color mix of Pink → Aqua → Deep Yellow.

Gradient should animate smoothly across the letters (CSS gradient text).

Keep the typewriter effect: text types letter by letter → pause 5 sec → deletes letter by letter → repeats infinitely.
